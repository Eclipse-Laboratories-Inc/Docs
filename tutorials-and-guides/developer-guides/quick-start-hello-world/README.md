# Quick Start: "Hello World"

These guides walk you through deploying a simple smart contract to Eclipse Testnet or Eclipse Devnet.

Eclipse runs the Solana VM (SVM), so you can deploy smart contracts on it just like you would on Solana.

Here's a simple step-by-step tutorial on deploying a "Hello World" contract to Eclipse Testnet and Devnet. The experience of deploying to our testnet or devnet will closely resemble a mainnet deployment.

This guide works right out of the box on Linux and macOS. We recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if you're using Windows. Check the official [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/wsl/wsl-introduction/introduction) for setting it up.
