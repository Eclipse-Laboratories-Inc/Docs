# Step 4: Download Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. It's essential for developing decentralized applications (DApps) on the Eclipse blockchain, as it enables you to run scripts, tests, and interact with the blockchain through JavaScript.

1. **Navigate to the Node.js Download Page**:
   * Access the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to find the installer suited for your Windows system.
2. **Choose the Correct Version**:
   * For most users, the LTS (Long-Term Support) version is recommended as it provides a more stable and well-supported Node.js environment. Click on the "Windows Installer" link to start the download.
3.  **Install Node.js**:

    * Once the installer is downloaded, run it. Follow the installation prompts, accepting the license agreement and selecting the default installation options unless you have specific needs.
    * The installer will also include npm (Node Package Manager), which is vital for managing your project's dependencies.\
