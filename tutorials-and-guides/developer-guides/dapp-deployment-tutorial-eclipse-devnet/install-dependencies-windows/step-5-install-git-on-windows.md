# Step 5: Install Git on Windows

Git is critical for version control and collaboration in software development, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate with others on your project. Installing Git on Windows will enable you to manage your NFT project's source code efficiently.

1. **Navigate to the Git Download Page**:
   * Visit the [Git download page for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to access the Git installer for Windows. The website should automatically suggest the best version for your system.
2.  **Download and Install Git**:

    * Click on the link to download the installer. Once the download is complete, run the installer.
    * During the installation process, you can accept the default settings, which are suitable for most users. Advanced users can customize the installation options according to their preferences.
