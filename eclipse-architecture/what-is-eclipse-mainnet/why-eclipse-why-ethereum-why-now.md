# Why Eclipse, Why Ethereum, Why Now

## Introduction to Rollup Technologies and Their Impact on Ethereum

Rollups have significantly advanced the state of research within the cryptocurrency industry, providing Ethereum users with cost-efficient alternatives compared to Layer 1 solutions. However, these technologies have yet to fully leverage the latest advancements necessary for mass adoption.

## Evolution and Limitations of Early Rollups

Initially, early rollups focused primarily on EVM compatibility and optimizing Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. While effective at the outset, these early solutions now lag behind due to recent technological developments, including:

* **High-performance, Parallelized Virtual Machines**: Such as SVM.
* **Data Availability Scaling**: Supported by DAS light node technologies like Celestia.
* **Advancements in Proof Infrastructure**: Making practical applications widespread, as seen with RISC Zero.
* **Increased Code and User Portability**: With tools like Neon, Solang, and user portability solutions such as MetaMask Snaps.

## Strategic Insights from Eclipse

Eclipse has capitalized on historical insights, identifying and integrating the most effective technological solutions to scale efficiently and sustainably. Despite discussions around the potential for a million app-specific rollups, practical applications for such extensive customization are limited. Most new rollups are merely standard EVM forks, which do not sufficiently address the fragmentation of user experience across multiple chains.

## The Vision of Unified Chains

The infrastructure necessary to support numerous application-specific chains with a competitive user experience is likely several years away. Current initiatives like Optimism's Superchain, zkSync's Hyperchains, and Arbitrum's Orbit chains aim to enhance user experience within their ecosystems but fall short of competing with a unified shared state or addressing cross-ecosystem interoperability.

## Solana's Influence and the Misconceptions of Compatibility

Eclipse appreciates Solana's straightforward approachâ€”a single, optimized shared state machine designed to handle the majority of significant use cases. This model, often perceived as incompatible with a rollup-centric roadmap, aligns well with Eclipse's goals to synthesize the best attributes of both strategies.

## Current Rollups and the Need for Innovation

Current rollups often rely on a basic, single-threaded EVM to capitalize on early network effects, which proves inadequate for specific applications like high-demand NFT mints that can disrupt pricing across an entire chain. Instead of creating separate chains for each application, Eclipse advocates for using a parallelized VM with localized fee markets, exemplified by the SVM.

## The Future of Eclipse Mainnet

Eclipse Mainnet merges Solana's performance with the security, verifiability, and network effects of a rollup-centric approach, embodying Ethereum's ethos of thriving on innovation. This integration allows Layer 2 solutions to utilize Ethereum's network benefits while exploring innovative execution environments. Eclipse Mainnet is positioned as a comprehensive solution, ready to adopt future advancements and maintain its status as a competitive Ethereum Layer 2 platform.
