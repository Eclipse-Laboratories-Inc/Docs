# Settlement - Ethereum

## **Eclipse Mainnet: Key Features and Security Benefits**

### **Validating Bridge Integration**:

Eclipse Mainnet includes a validating bridge built directly into its infrastructure. This bridge plays a critical role in establishing the "canonical chain," which is respected by all Eclipse nodes.

### **Concurrent Ethereum Full Nodes**:

To ensure accurate transaction sequencing, Eclipse nodes must run a full Ethereum node alongside the Eclipse node. This integration brings Ethereum’s security benefits to the Eclipse network.

### **Security Features**:

* The validating bridge authenticates all transactions, preventing invalid states from being submitted to the Eclipse network.
* Guarantees "eventual liveness," ensuring the network continues to function even if the sequencer fails or attempts censorship.
* Offers **censorship resistance**, allowing users to force their transactions through the bridge even if Layer 2 censorship occurs.

### **Ethereum L2 Classification**:

* Eclipse Mainnet is classified as part of Ethereum Layer 2 networks, similar to validiums and optimums.

### **Ethereum as the Preferred Currency**:

* Given the importance of Ethereum-native assets in DeFi and NFT markets, **Ethereum (ETH)** is the chosen decentralized currency for Eclipse Mainnet.
* ETH will also be used as the gas token for transactions on the network.

### **Future Fee Flexibility**:

* **Fee abstraction** is planned, allowing users to pay gas fees with tokens like USDC.
* There are currently no plans to introduce a proprietary token for Eclipse Mainnet.
