## Responsible Disclosure

Our [bug bounty](../developers/eclipse-bug-bounty-program.md) is now listed on Immunefi. Start taking a look and wait for the launch to report vulnerabilities!

* Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly or by executing them against a production network. If you do, not only will you be putting users at risk, but you will also forfeit your right to a reward.
* Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly, for example by filing a public ticket or Github issue.
* Do not test the vulnerability on a publicly available network, either the testnet or the mainnet.
